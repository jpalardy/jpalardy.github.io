  <p>
  My name is Jonathan Palardy.
  </p>

  <p>
  Day-to-day, I work with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a>
  to write network services. I'm interested in UNIX, Vim, statistics with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>,
  monitoring and backend development.
  </p>

  <p>
  I love books and have a <a href="https://bookpiles.ca/">website</a> to keep track of what I read.

  <p>
  I live in Vancouver, British Columbia.
