  <p>
  I currently work at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> following the
  acquisition of <a href="http://www.xobni.com/">Xobni</a> in July 2013. I am
  one of the secret weapons used to make the magic all work.
  </p>

  <p>
  Day-to-day, I work with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a>
  to write network services. I'm interested in UNIX, Vim, statistics with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>,
  monitoring and backend development.
  </p>

  <p>
  I collect programming languages to see how different people think about
  programming. I'm spending time with Go, Lua, Haskell, and plain old C.
  </p>

  <p>
  I love books and have a <a href="http://bookpiles.ca/">website</a> to keep track of what I read.
