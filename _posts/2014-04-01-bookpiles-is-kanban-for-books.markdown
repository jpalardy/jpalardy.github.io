title: Bookpiles is Kanban for Books
category: posts
---

The [Personal Kanban](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1453802266/?tag=bookpiles02-20) book
came with a feeling of déjà vu: I had already been doing all that with my
books! When I wrote [bookpiles.ca](https://bookpiles.ca/), a little web
application to track the books I read, I had no idea I was doing Kanban.


## Rule 1: Visualize Your Work

Visualization is central to bookpiles, the book covers _are_ the books and they
are moved between "piles". I wanted things I could manipulate, making an
analogy with the physical world.

_Ceci n'est pas un livre?_

It would be nice to see the books in different piles at the same time, but
while a Kanban board contains a handful of tasks, [my bookpiles](https://bookpiles.ca/jonathan/books)
contain hundreds of books. The books also spend longer in each column, and
forever in "done".

I was surprised to find that the name and purpose of piles in bookpiles were
very close to the recommended columns in Kanban.

Kanban columns versus piles:

* backlog: maybe and buy
* ready: ready
* doing: reading
* done: done
* pen: stalled

You hear about books and hold them in "maybe" or even "buy". This is similar to
the concept of the "wishlist" on Amazon, except to express the level of
commitment that you feel.

You select books (presumably buy books) and they become "ready". At this point,
you have already commited yourself.

You read books and they hold their position in "reading". There's a maximum
number of books that makes sense here, see the next section.

You might get derailed and banish books to "stalled", the pen.

You, hopefully, retire books to "done".


## Rule 2: Limit Your Work-in-Progress

This is a lesson I learned the hard way, but early on. With my newfound
clarity, I started reading too many books at the same time. The results were
disappointing: slow or uneven progress, losing track of content -- I was
juggling too many balls.

Since then, I have tried to limit myself to 1 or 2 concurrent books. I try to do
a "fun" book and an "improvement" book.

I found that audio books allow me to add one more book to the WIP. Audio books
don't steal time from regular books, they are a parallel track: I listen to
audio books when I commute, wash dishes or do other chores.


## Results

Bookpiles has certainly kept me focused. I know what I'm supposed to be
reading, what books are coming up, and it holds a reference to all the books
I've heard about that I might want to read someday.

I also *love* moving the books from one pile to another--especially to "done".
Then, I can get excited about what I'm going to read next.
