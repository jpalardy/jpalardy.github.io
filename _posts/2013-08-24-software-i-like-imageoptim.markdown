[ImageOptim][imageoptim] is software that makes me happy. It's a simple
install, does one thing and does it well: it tries to reduce the size of image
files losslessly.

Here's the 15-second demo:

Drag-and-drop to get â‰ˆ70% reduction in file size? Yes.

Of course, the amount of compression you'll get will depend on a lot of
factors, most of which you and I never tried to understand. And if we
understood them, we could manually feed the right parameters to the compressors
that ImageOptim uses.

If you want to start tweaking, there are preferences for that:

When do I use ImageOptim? All the time. But if you're looking for more specific
use cases:

- when I take a screenshot, and I'm about to email/share it
- when I put an image online
- when I integrate an asset into a webapp

It never hurts to see if I can squeeze out a little more: ImageOptim won't
modify the image unless it can compress it.

One warning: ImageOptim modifies files in-place. If you have "master" files, I
would recommend making copies and working off of those (always a good idea).
