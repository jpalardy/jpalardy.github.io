title: The Best Books I Read in 2020
category: posts

I have read many books in 2020; let's forget most and talk about the good ones.

There is no particular order, but I broke down my recommendations by
categories: [technical](#technical), [non-fiction](#non-fiction) and
[fiction](#fiction).

This is a yearly tradition! You can read my book reviews for

## Technical

### Programming Phoenix

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680502263/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/1680502263.jpg" alt="Programming Phoenix" /></a>

Before reading this book, I felt that I needed to read a
[bunch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593274351/)
[of](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680502999/)
[other](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617295027/)
[books](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680506617/)
first. ðŸ˜¢ I made the same mistake with Ruby and Rails...

At heart, I'm a web developer and that's what I care about. Knowing _HOW_ I can use Elixir
to build a webapp was so much more practical than the bottoms-up I took.

I only have good things to say about this book:
- it's at the "right level"
- it covers what you need, when you need it
- it doesn't go too deep (it doesn't try to be an introduction _AND_ a reference book)

If you follow along, you'll end up building just enough of a webapp to give you
an idea about whether Phoenix and Elixir are right for you.

Afterwards, I _would_ recommend [Programming Elixir](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680502999/), which covers the language
in more detail. It's a great book, and I'm surprised it didn't make it to my [2018](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2018/) recommendations... ðŸ¤”
(maybe I felt that learning Elixir in a vacuum didn't make sense...)

### Elm in Action

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617294047/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/1617294047.jpg" alt="Elm in Action" /></a>

I had been wanting to learn Elm for a while, and I found __Elm in Action__
to be a gem!

Yes, Elm has a [guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/), but I cannot say that it
was the easiest to follow or the most organized -- especially for someone (me)
going in cold. To be fair, I went through the guide _after_ the book and found
(in retrospect) that it made complete sense (a feeling probably shared with the
authors of the guide).

__Elm in Action__ is a tutorial in book format. It walks you through a project,
introducing concepts and adding functionality one chapter at a time.
I thought that the pace, order of presentation, and tone were
_perfect_: each section clarified a previous point, or answered my next
question.

From the preface:

> ... I realized I was describing the book I wished I'd had back when I first
> set out to learn functional programming. [...] I wanted that book to exist so
> badly, I volunteered to write it.

Mission accomplished! I would recommend this book either for Elm enthusiasts,
but also for people wanting to get deeper into functional programming.

### Game Programming Patterns

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/0990582906.jpg" alt="Game Programming Patterns" /></a>

__Game Programming Patterns__ is another no-brainer: I found it
interesting and relevant -- even if I'm not a game developer.
(also: I had seen it recommended so many times, it was hard to avoid...)

[Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/) is _old_ and not
necessarily the most enjoyable read. And though Amazon says the book is (still) a
best seller, it's unclear how many people have read it. It's refreshing to see
an updated take on _patterns_, with modern examples and opinions about what
to do and what to avoid.

I had the opportunity to apply some of the ideas from the book to a project at work;
it made the code more flexible and simplified the architecture. It's unclear if the
book was the _cause_, but it certainly was an inspiration ðŸ˜„

There are also a few chapters on optimization patterns, of which "data locality" is close to my heart.
Overall, it was a fun read, and gave me ideas to (hopefully) untangle future code messes.

## Non-Fiction

### White Fragility

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807047414/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/0807047414.jpg" alt="White Fragility" /></a>

What a year 2020 was! During the [George Floyd protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests),
there were many proposed reading lists, like [this one](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/anti-racist-reading-list.html).
Fighting racism starts with yourself and I thought it would be good to do some
homework.

A few names and titles kept coming back; I ended up reading (in this order):

- [So You Want to Talk About Race](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580056776/)
- [How to Be an Antiracist](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525509283/)
- [White Fragility](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807047414/)

Let me be clear about this: I enjoyed _and_ recommend all 3 books ... but I felt
that __White Fragility__ probably hit the hardest.

I tried to gather my thoughts, but I think wikipedia page did a better job:

> DiAngelo coined the term "white fragility" in 2011 to describe any defensive
> instincts or reactions that a white person experiences when questioned about
> race or made to consider their own race. In White Fragility, DiAngelo views
> racism in the United States as systemic and often perpetuated unconsciously
> by individuals. She recommends against viewing racism as committed
> intentionally by "bad people".

If you ever thought "... but I'm not racist!", this is __exactly__ the book for you.

If you need to _ease_ into it, I would start with [So You Want to Talk About Race](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580056776/).

- [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807047414/) -- all books also linked above ^

### Never Split the Difference

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847941494/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/1847941494.jpg" alt="Never Split the Difference" /></a>

I admit, grudgingly, that __Never Split the Difference__ had some good advice.

But, like many non-fiction books, it could have been a much _thinner_ book. And it
could have been called "A Bunch of Stories about my Time as a Hostage Negotiator" ...
but that's not as catchy.

In the end, it's a book about letting others "help you to help them": it talks about
mirroring, and variants on "how am I supposed to do that?". Every time that I've remembered
the techniques and put them to use, I was surprised at how well they worked!

This book is an update on classics like __Getting to Yes__ (1981) and __Start with NO__ (2002).
While not wrong, we've learned much since then, and this book contrasts different approaches.

Whether business or interpersonal, even putting this book into practice _once_ will pay the price
of the book multiple times over.

### Science Fictions

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250222699/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/1250222699.jpg" alt="Science Fictions" /></a>

I first heard about this book from the article:
[You Want to See My Data? I Thought We Were Friends!](http://nautil.us/blog/you-want-to-see-my-data-i-thought-we-were-friends).
The article, though __unfortunately__ not the book, is illustrated by the [@smbc](https://www.smbc-comics.com/) guy:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp//"><img style="width: 338px" src="/assets/best-books-2020/thought-we-were-friends.png" alt="comic sample" /></a>

This book is critical of science (for good reasons) while remaining pro-science:
the way for science to _heal_ itself is _through_ science.
[Metascience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience), "the use of
scientific methodology to study science itself", is the backdrop of the
critique.

There are chapters dedicated to the problems of science:
- fraud
- bias
- negligence
- hype

It's a mess out there, mostly because of how science is currently incentivized.
Don't lose all hope: the final chapter is called "Fixing Science", and it
highlights some of the solutions that are possible (though it isn't meant to be a
comprehensive list).

- [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250222699/)

### Mastery

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452267560/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/0452267560.jpg" alt="Mastery" /></a>

Written in 1992, __Mastery__ felt like the "original source" for many other
things that I've read over the years. (think 10,000 hours, etc) It's part of a
certain philosophy about living your life.

Mastery is a journey:
- good news: you can start today!
- bad news: it's going to take years...

The modern world promises quick-and-simple solutions to most problems ... it takes
a certain perspective to accept that it's going to take more time/work.

You also need to know that the journey to mastery will mostly be spent on
plateaus -- long periods where progress is stagnant. Depending on your
outlook, you will give up, double-down, coast, or "transcend". I
don't think we can (or should) master everything; it becomes a question of
priorities. But it's helpful to make those decisions consciously.

This is another could-have-been-a-shorter book, but I really enjoyed the first half.

### How to Invent Everything

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735220158/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/0735220158.jpg" alt="How to Invent Everything" /></a>

Oh no: your time machine broke down, and now you're stuck in the past?! Don't worry, this guide
will bootstrap your civilization to a relative level of comfort...

This is part history book, part "how to" guide, wrapped in a thin layer of tongue-in-cheek humor.
Written by Ryan North, of [Dinosaur Comics](https://qwantz.com/) fame, it's a decent effort at
accomplishing "a survival guide for the stranded time traveler".

We live in an ever-increasingly complex society and, proportionally, understand
less and less of it. This creates an anxiety: "if the world came apart, I
wouldn't know how anything works..." (this is reflected in the popularity of
games like Civilization, Minecraft or Factorio ... or other games with
[technology trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree)).
Deep down, most people want to feel self-reliant and feel like they
can manage complexity.

While I sometimes found the humor tedious (especially after a few chapters), I
concede that it might make the book more palatable to a certain audience. I
learned a bunch of things and this is a book that I keep thinking about.

_(it also made me look for other world-from-scratch books, some of which will probably make
an appearance next year)_

## Fiction

I read a bunch of fiction that I enjoyed this year ... but not many books that I could recommend
whole-heartedly. Even this one comes with a disclaimer.

### Cyteen

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007JQNCPI/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2020/B007JQNCPI.jpg" alt="Cyteen" /></a>

If fiction, and especially science fiction, is supposed to "take you places" or
let you (safely) experience things you normally wouldn't, then __Cyteen__ is worth discussing.

Humanity ventured into space and divided due to the long distances. One
possible solution to populate and bootstrap new worlds is cloning.
__Cyteen__ is a book exploring cloning and its ramifications:
- is cloning -- for a purpose -- slavery?
- does a society based on cloning require mind control?
- what about cloning specific individuals? (and hoping to reproduce successes?)
- what are the benefits/downsides of free will?

__Cyteen__ won the 1989 [Hugo award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel) (that's how I found it).

The whole book made me feel uncomfortable, claustrophobic and paranoid; living in a completely
different world and spending decades with its main characters. I found the [worldbuilding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding)
impressive, and I'm going to look for more from [the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Cherryh).
