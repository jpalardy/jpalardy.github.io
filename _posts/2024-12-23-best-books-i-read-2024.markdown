title: The Best Books I Read in 2024
category: posts
---
I have read many books in 2024; let's forget most and talk about the good ones.

There is no particular order, but I broke down my recommendations by
categories: [technical](#technical), [non-fiction](#non-fiction) and
[fiction](#fiction).

This is a yearly tradition! You can read my book reviews from previous years:

## Technical

### Tidy First?

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098151240/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2024/1098151240.jpg" alt="Tidy First?" /></a>

This is a short (<100 pages) and cute book. If you need to change some code,
where do you start? You could tidy first (maybe).

It says it's meant to be the first book of a series (bring it on!), and it starts with the simplest
hard-to-disagree-with techniques. If, instead of programming, we were talking
about cooking, this book would be filled with tips like:
- wash your hands
- check the fridge
- clean the cooking surfaces
- prepare the ingredients ... ðŸ¤£

Seriously: there is an "hygiene" to working on certain codebases. And though
these techniques are not the "big wins" that we tend to focus on, all the
tips add up to something worthwhile. The hope is that every
little step leads to a point where a bigger win is possible, obvious
even, because all the clutter has been taken away.

### A Philosophy of Software Design

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2024/173210221X.jpg" alt="A Philosophy of Software Design" /></a>

This is another short book with most of its value front-loaded.
By chapter 2, we were getting into the real questions:

What is complexity?

> Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system
> that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.

and, what are the symptoms of complexity?

- change amplification
- cognitive load
- unknown unknowns

The discussion about deep and shallow modules gave me much to think about.
As a software professional, I keep thinking about my audience: is this the
right abstraction? is it easy to use? is it flexible enough? After reading
**A Philosophy of Software Design**, I feel like I'm being more thoughtful
and intentional.

I agreed with almost all the recommendations. This is a book that I can get
behind, _especially_ compared to **Clean Code**, which is mentioned and used as a
point of comparison.

### Debugging

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0814474578/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2024/0814474578.jpg" alt="Debugging" /></a>

At work, I've been focusing on investigating and explaining some of the deepest
bugs that we have found. Though I've been successful, I can't say that I've
felt "organized". I went looking for books that
could explain the process and give me a better methodology.

The clickbait subtitle worked for me:

> The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software
> and Hardware Problems

The rules even come in poster form, to hang on your wall. (full resolution [here](https://debuggingrules.com/?page_id=40))

<a href="/assets/best-books-2024/debuggingrules.jpg"><img style="width: 50%; margin: auto; display: block" src="/assets/best-books-2024/debuggingrules.jpg" alt="Debugging rules poster" /></a>

The author makes a strong pitch:

> Well, in my twentyâˆ’six years of experience designing and debugging systems, I've discovered two things:
>
> 1. When it took us a long time to find a bug, it was because we had neglected some essential, fundamental rule; once we applied the rule, we quickly found the problem.
>
> 2. People who excelled at quick debugging inherently understood and applied these rules. Those who struggled to understand or use these rules struggled to find bugs.
>
> I compiled a list of these essential rules; I've taught them to other engineers
> and watched their debugging skill and speed increase. They really, really work.

I enjoyed the war stories, even when some of them showed their age. I think that only proves how the process hasn't changed!

## Non-Fiction

### Chip War

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1398504106/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2024/1398504106.jpg" alt="Chip War" /></a>

I saw **Chip War** recommended on [SNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service); it was also the Financial Times
[2022](https://ig.ft.com/sites/business-book-award/#2022) business book of the
year. It was so good, it made me wonder what else I could read from the nominees.

The back cover said it read like a "nonfiction thriller"! The joke is on me, because
that's exactly how it felt: I wanted to know what happened next, and I was worried about the future
_even if_ I mostly knew how the story ends.

The book is chronological, going from the very beginning, the invention of
the transistor, all the way to the present and current geopolitical tensions.
Each chapter is short, usually â‰ˆ10 pages, and focused on a self-contained story.

I wasn't aware of the history of chipmaking, let alone the side stories.
Working in tech, I felt it's easy to dismiss technology
[because it's everywhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=joke+fish+what+is+water&udm=2).
It's only since the pandemic and shortage supplies that I've been thinking more
about computer chips, how important they are, but how **HARD** they are to make.

### Lying for Money

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1781259666/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2024/1781259666.jpg" alt="Lying for Money" /></a>

I came up on this book while reading [The fraud supply chain](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-fraud-supply-chain/).
In particular, one quote (also present in the book) caught my eye:

> The right amount of fraud is not zero

Really?! Tell me more. It must be one of those fact that's only counter-intuitive
for outsiders. (it was!)

The short take is that frauds exist because our societies have trust. And the more trust,
the more potential for fraud: it's the "Canadian paradox"! ([discussion](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2020/03/04/scientific-fraud-vs-financial-fraud-the-canadian-paradox/))

It starts with the simplest frauds, along the lines of "thou shalt not steal" and "thou shalt not bear false witness" but it keeps climbing
levels of abstraction and complexity. As the book says:

> [...] but where's the commandment "Thou shalt not trade securities while in possession of material non-public information"?

I didn't know much about fraud, nor had I spent a lot of cycles thinking about
it. I learned a few things, was entertained, and gained some perspective.

## Fiction

### ShoÌ„gun

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYTHP9J/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2024/B0CPYTHP9J.jpg" alt="ShoÌ„gun" /></a>

When TV shows roll out, my attitude is to wait and see. Even if it starts
strong, will it be good until the end? In the case of **ShoÌ„gun**, the verdict
seemed unanimous: Rotten Tomato says
[99%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/shogun_2024).

I thought the TV show was excellent on its own. But I wanted more and the book
did not disappoint. Even though there was significant overlap -- especially for
the first half of the book -- I felt the book gave more _depth_; it had more time to
cover characters, schemes and motivations. That's the good stuff.

Slight rant: most historical stories take _contemporary_ characters and put them in costumes ðŸ˜¬ That isn't what **ShoÌ„gun**
attempted: you definitely get a feel that "people were different" back then. I think that's especially true for the culture
shock of Europeans landing in Japan.

The book ends _more or less_ where the first season ends. Although it decided to leave the rest
to [history books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate).

(I was curious to see [what else Clavell had written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clavell#Novels). I'll report back next year.)
