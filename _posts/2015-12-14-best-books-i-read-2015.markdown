title: "The Best Books I Read in 2015"
category: posts
---

I have read many books in 2015 but it wasn't all good. Some books, however,
deserve to be acknowledged. I broke down my recommendations by categories:
[technical](#technical), [non-fiction](#non-fiction) and [fiction](#fiction).
There is no particular order.

-------------------------------------------------

## Technical

### An Introduction to Statistical Learning

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/1461471370.jpg" alt="An Introduction to Statistical Learning" />

This book wasn't planned. Last January, I heard about the [MOOC](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about),
and saw that people were excited about it. I started the class, bought the
book and I learned *many* things I didn't know ... but I was an ML beginner.

Eventually, I took the [Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and it reinforced everything I had learned in Statistical Learning.

I felt that I had read the book too fast the first time around. When I got back
to this book, in October, I re-read it cover-to-cover and found that it was now
a "review" and "obvious" -- a stark departure from where I had been at the
beginning of the year.

The [Statistical Learning MOOC](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) is being given again in January 2016. I strongly recommend it.

## Non-Fiction

### The Case For Mars

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/145160811X.jpg" alt="The Case For Mars" />

Many other books on Mars, both fiction and non-fiction, refer to this book
first published in 1996. This book will sell you why we must go to Mars, how
we can do it, and how to keep the costs down -- reasonable even.

If you liked [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel\)) and would like to:

* see how much it has been influenced by this book
* get even deeper into the details

you will be pleased.

Does our generation need a [BIG project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ&feature=youtu.be&t=103)? In that case, let's fix global warming. And let's go to Mars -- let's do both.

### The Checklist Manifesto

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/0312430000.jpg" alt="The Checklist Manifesto" />

From airline pilots to surgeons, checklists save lives. It's a short book that
could have been shorter, but still an enjoyable read.

Anywhere where many steps are necessary and skipping ahead can have
consequences, checklists can help. The book covers many examples, through
stories, and tries to convince that "we don't need a checklist" is a
(demonstratively) false and reckless idea.

### Superintelligence

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/0199678111.jpg" alt="Superintelligence" />

This was a recommendation from [CGP Grey](http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/52) and I started out as a
skeptic. This sounds like Skynet, and I've already watched that movie. (and others worse)

However, most people in the field believe that we will be able to design a
machine with human-level intelligence -- the real question is one of timeline:
in 10 years, 50 years, 100 years? What's going to happen after that? Probably
nothing good.

This book says that superintelligence _might_ happen, and covers:

* the different types of possible superintelligence
* what a superintelligence might be capable of
* different outcomes and scenarios
* how to control a superintelligence, if possible

The newyorker has an [introductory article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom) about it.

I went through the whole book thinking that there was a good idea for a
science-fiction novel every 2-3 pages. But it also made me realize that
I had always assumed that it was impossible, or not something to worry about.
I recommend the book, *especially* if you disagree with the premise.

### Economix

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/0810988399.jpg" alt="Economix" />

Economic ideas often hide behind jargon and formulas -- it doesn't have to be
like that. Here is a comic book that covers the history of economics and
presents many concepts in a _very_ approachable way.

* What works and what doesn't?
* What are the myths?
* Austerity or government spending?

The author has done his homework and brings information from an extensive
bibliography. I just wish more subjects could be covered in this format. This
is [edutainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_entertainment) at
its best.

## Fiction

### Revelation Space

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/0441009425.jpg" alt="Revelation Space" />

Humans have spread to nearby stars, all _without_ [FTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light) drives, and there are
many mysteries to explore in this dark [space opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera).

I liked the first book because it touched on many interesting ideas -- one of
my favorite being the [Fermi paradox](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html).
I kept reading to explore different aspects of this universe, and to see how
things were going to work out.

### The Three-Body Problem

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/0765377063.jpg" alt="The Three-Body Problem" />

I kept hearing about Liu Cixin, [China's Arthur C. Clarke](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/chinas-arthur-c-clarke). It doesn't hurt that the book won the 2015 Hugo award. Science-fiction is often inspired by American culture and descriptions of the book hinted at "something different".

It's hard to talk about the book without revealing spoilers. It's part of a
trilogy and I read the first two books. Let's just say it's well done,
unusual, and that I can't wait for the third book to be translated to English.

### Aurora

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2015/0316098108.jpg" alt="Aurora" />

This book comes from Kim Stanley Robinson, the author of the excellent
[Mars Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy). It also falls under
the [hard science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction) category.
The book follows a [generation ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_ship) on its
way to colonize another star system.

Like any good science fiction, it raises more questions than it answers:

* Is it ethical to colonize with a generation ship?
* From a technical point of view, what are the challenges?
* Is it even possible for humans to colonize new worlds?

As an introduction, here's a [short video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T1-lE5i98M) with the author.

Mr.Robinson's style is meandering; there is a lot of reflections, descriptions
and dialogues. To me that's an essential part of what makes his stories rich, deep
and ... mournful. Nostalgia is why I keep coming back.
