I have read many books in 2019; let's forget most and talk about the good ones.

There is no particular order, but I broke down my recommendations by
categories: [technical](#technical), [non-fiction](#non-fiction) and
[fiction](#fiction).

This is a yearly tradition! You can read my book reviews for

## Technical

### The Rust Programming Language

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718500440/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/1593278284.jpg" alt="The Rust Programming Language" /></a>

Last year, I wrote about [Programming Rust](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2018/#programming-rust)
and how I felt about the language. This year, I feel the same but stronger. ðŸ˜„

I've given Rust a good effort and did a major chunk of the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)
in Rust. Overall: it's not perfect but it's definitely one of my favorite languages.

If I could go back, I would want to read __The Rust Programming Language__
first. It's well-written, accessible, and friendly. And, good news,
the book is [available online](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for free.

I would still read __Programming Rust__, which I feel reinforced the ideas and
presented from a slightly different perspective. I also think it makes for a
better reference book.

__The Rust Programming Language__ is sometimes just called "the book". In
practice, I had found the online version without ever connecting it to the
physical book -- I didn't know it was the _same_ bookâ€¦ everything is obvious
(only) in retrospect.

### Kubernetes in Action

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617293725/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/1617293725.jpg" alt="Kubernetes in Action" /></a>

> Did you know that Kubernetes means  
"complicated" in Greek? \</joke\>

Seriously, I have mixed feelings about Kubernetes. Yes, it solves a bunch of
problems we had with deployment, redundancy, resource utilization, etc ... but
it's an ecosystem of technologies that is super complicated, and, seemingly,
not getting simpler -- or, at least, not yet. It feels like a [Faustian pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust),
a tradeoff of conveniences and complexities that I'm not always ready to embrace.

The good news is __Kubernetes in Action__ is a life-saver. I only have good
things to say about this book. The subject matter itself is dry and it's not
exactly bedside reading material -- but, the book itself is clearly-written,
logically organized, contains most of what you need to know, and serves as a
great reference.

If you work with Kubernetes and need to untangle it all, this is the book for you.

### The Linux Programming Interface

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272200/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/1593272200.jpg" alt="The Linux Programming Interface" /></a>

This one is a tough one....

First of all, it's a monster of a book: it's 1552 pages, weighs over 5 lbs (2.3 kg)
and could be used to kill someone.

As for the content, it is generous with sample C code, historical explanations,
and warnings about the (in)compatiblity mess we live in.

This was _not_ a book that I enjoyed reading ... and yet, I was happy to have
read it (especially when it was done). I found that other parts of the
programming world suddenly "made sense", given the proper historical
context. Also, it's sometimes easier to understand how things work
when you know what lies underneath.

My recommendation: use it as a reference, skip the C code until you need it,
and browse the table of contents first.

## Non-Fiction

### Why We Sleep

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501144316/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/1501144316.jpg" alt="Why We Sleep" /></a>

We spend almost a â…“ of our lives sleeping, but science still doesn't have clear
answers about the purpose of sleep... until now?

There was a lot of buzz when this book came out, and the author was suddenly
everywhere talking about his book. Bill Gates also [reviewed the book](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-We-Sleep)
and it made his [shortlist](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2019).

Sleep research has been progressing slowly over time. We have solved some of
the mysteries, and have never known more than we do now. This book acts
as a summary of the research and findings.

I was already a believer in "a good night's sleep"; hopefully 8 hours during
the week, and more on the weekend. This book didn't have to do a lot of
convincing... Sleeping is good, and the lack of sleep will ruin your health.

But, I felt that the book was overreaching by the end: "more sleep" had
become the author's one-solution to all problems. (Bill Gates echoes the feeling)

### Because Internet

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735210934/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/0735210934.jpg" alt="Because Internet" /></a>

Languages evolve and the Internet seems to accelerate the process. It also
allows linguists to track trends over time and space in a way that wasn't
possible before.

For example, the book goes over the (relatively recent) adoption of "hello" as
a greeting. It became popular because it was used to answer the phone.
Previously, people used "hi" or "good morning" as a greeting, while "hello" was used to
attract someone's attention.

This book is filled with a bunch of those stories like this one, and other historical
perspective on slang, jargon, punctuation, capitalization, emojis, memes, and
so much more.

[The medium is the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message), and that's
also a focus of this book: the technologies you use and when you adopted them
will influence _how_ you communicate. It's interesting stuff especially if
you've lived through most of it.

### Envisioning Information

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1930824149/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/1930824149.jpg" alt="Envisioning Information" /></a>

The author, [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte),
published a series of beautiful books about information design. This one just
happens to be the first one I picked up.

The whole collection:

- [The Visual Display of Information](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1930824130/)
- [Visual Explanations](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1930824157/)
- [Envisioning Information](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1930824149/)
- [Beautiful Evidence](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1930824165/)

These books are seminal works on information design; the books that other books put
in their bibliographies. It's easy to read Tufte's books and claim "it's
obvious" while forgetting that you're reading _the_ original source!

Beyond the historical importance, it's a guided tour through good and bad data
visualizations. What's the best way to display data? What are the alternatives?
What's the importance of color, contrast, comparison? How many dimensions can
fit in a 2D visualization?

Beautiful examples from many sources (geographical and historical) are given,
sometimes with explanations, sometimes for you to contemplate.

### The Nature of Technology

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1416544062/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/1416544062.jpg" alt="The Nature of Technology" /></a>

What is technology?

Is it obvious? Or do you need a moment to pin it down?

__The Nature of Technology__ is an "academic" book that seemed focused on "the details",
but that also explained things I hadn't fully understood before.

The main ideas are summarized [here](https://www.the-vital-edge.com/the-nature-of-technology/). Here's one example:

- technologies are usually built from other (sub-)technologies, recursively
- "base" technologies are based on exploiting physical phenomena

ðŸ¤” yeah... I guess.

More importantly (for me): new "superior" technologies often take decades to be
adopted because of the "ecosystem" of technologies necessary to exploit them to
their full extent.

For example: a new programming language might have many
advantages ... but until tooling catches up, useful libraries are written, and
enough people know how to use it effectively, the "advantages" might be
balanced by more pragmatic considerations. Eventually, the adoption of that new
language is "obvious" (especially for new projects), but it might take a long
time to get there. Old technologies take a long time to die.

## Fiction

### Commune

_Series: 4 books, complete._

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0771Q2MMN/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/B0771Q2MMN.jpg" alt="Commune" /></a>

I think the most interesting aspect of zombie books is how society
disintegrates, almost overnight. What happens afterwards often focuses on
the group dynamics and the drama (\*cough\* the walking dead \*cough\*).

There are no zombies in __Commune__, but it definitely falls into that category
of stories. I've explained it as a zombie-story-without-zombies; in this case,
it's a solar storm, followed by a plague.

As usual, everything goes to shit. People divide "the real assholes",
"psychopaths on the loose" and "good people who must do bad things"... It's a
bit predictable but it's an enjoyable and heartbreaking ride.

What made __Commune__ special was:

- narration by [R.C. Bray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._C._Bray)
- good character development: the author is going to make you care before making you cry
- Gibbs, the foul-mouthed no-nonsense Marine!

It's not high art, but it's a fun read.

### Ancillary Justice

_Series: 3 books, complete._

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/031624662X/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/031624662X.jpg" alt="Ancillary Justice" /></a>

This book had been on my shortlist for a while; it won the Hugo, Nebula, Locus
Awards and a bunch more. The Audible reviews, however, were very critical of the
narration... I did what I wouldn't normally do: I read it in paper format.

I can understand the narration challenges: the book is narrated from the perspective on an
[AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#In_fiction) who
inhabits multiple bodies at the same time -- making singular and plural
subjective. On top of that, the AI is gender-blind, so the default pronoun for
all characters is "she". It's only through indirect clues, or other people
talking, that gender is revealed.

No other book has made me want to wear gloves and drink tea as much as this
one ðŸ˜„ Although [Ninefox Gambit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GIOKBWI/) came
pretty close.

The AI perspective beyond the easy "AI wants to be human" or "AI wants to kill
us all" was refreshing. The "alien" perspective of being a spaceship _and_
having multiple bodies simultaneously was also interesting. There are a lot of
good ideas in there.

I felt the ending was both disappointing and satisfying at the same time. It
was ... an appropriate ending.

### House of Suns

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002MVI14M/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/B002MVI14M.jpg" alt="House of Suns" /></a>

I've read most of Alastair Reynolds's books... and picked this one up on a
whim. I prefer longer series but I had run out of material...

(Sidenote: I watched [Love, Death & Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Death_%26_Robots) and was impressed
by [Zima Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zima_Blue_and_Other_Stories), which I later discovered had been written by Alastair Reynolds.)

I read science fiction to be exposed to "things I had never thought about" ...
I try to avoid science fiction as "drama in space". This book did not disappoint. A sample:

- what does it mean to live for thousands of years? how do you cope?
- what is memory?
- what is gender? -- also covered in [Ancillary Justice](#ancillary-justice)
- the speed of light and relativity makes everything weird...

And when I thought "oh, that's what this story is about...", I found that I wasn't thinking big enough.

However, a warning: Reynolds doesn't "explain". His books expect you
to stick around long enough for the details to fall into place. That can be a
jarring experience, like being thrown in the middle of a conversation... I can
vouch that everything _eventually_ makes sense.

### Great North Road

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AVAQVAW/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2019/B00AVAQVAW.jpg" alt="Great North Road" /></a>

Another book from my "favorite author pile". __Great North Road__ is a
standalone book: it's a murder investigation, a monster story, a cover-up, and a
space opera.

Imagine a group of corporations ran by clones of the same man. Imagine
investigating the murder of an unidentified clone ... across multiple planets.
This one will keep you guessing...

The author, [Peter F. Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_F._Hamilton),
is known for his universe-building series and multiple intertwining storylines.
This book is a delicious appetizer hinting at what his other books offer. If
you like this one, there's a lot more where that came from.
