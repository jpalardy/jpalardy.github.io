First it was [Blogger](http://jpalardy.blogspot.ca/), then [Wordpress](http://technotales.wordpress.com/).

This time, I decided to "own" my blog and put it under my domain. This blog is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
themed by [Left](http://zachholman.com/posts/left/) (thank you, [Zach Holman](https://twitter.com/holman)).

I blog about technical things and, on other platforms, I always had to struggle
with code formatting, code highlighting and previewing. It's great to be able
to do it all locally, with a text-editor, and using source control. If I only
wrote stories, if it were all text, I'm sure it would matter a lot less.

All these little annoyances add up, and I hope to get back to blogging on a more
frequent basis. I always have something exciting to talk about, but not always
the time or willingness to blog about it.

This blog does not have comments, but I don't know (yet) if it matters. In any case, you
can reach me through [the](https://github.com/jpalardy) [usual](https://twitter.com/jpalardy) [channels](mailto:jonathan.palardy@gmail.com).
