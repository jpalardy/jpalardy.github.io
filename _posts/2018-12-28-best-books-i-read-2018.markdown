title: "The Best Books I Read in 2018"
category: posts
---

I have read many books in 2018; some good and some not so good.

Here are the books that deserve to be acknowledged. There is no particular
order.  
 I broke down my recommendations by categories: [technical](#technical),
[non-fiction](#non-fiction) and [fiction](#fiction).

I have similar posts for [2015](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/), [2016](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2016/) and [2017](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2017/).

## Technical

### Redis in Action

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617290858/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/1617290858.jpg" alt="Redis in Action" /></a>

I feel that Redis is _misunderstood_. What can it do? What is it for? What about persistence?

Redis has a few in-memory data structures. Each data structure supports a few
operations. Most tutorials will cover those and send you on your way. It's easy
to dismiss Redis as too simple.

But if you're building distributed systems -- and what modern application isn't to some extent? --
you want to lean on people who have "been-there, done-that" before.

**Redis in Action** reads like a bunch of war stories on how _not_ to implement
systems in Redis. Then it walks you through the problems and the "right way" to
do things. I loved [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2017/#designing-data-intensive-applications)
last year, and **Redis in Action** reminded of that book. I can't get enough of
stories on how to build real systems.

The book is available for free online, see below.

### Programming Rust

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491927283/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/1491927283.jpg" alt="Programming Rust" /></a>

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.

[Alan Perlis](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis#Epigrams_on_Programming,_1982)

Rust: the language everybody is talking about. Or that's how it feels. I wanted
to know what the big deal was, so I picked up this book to get an overview.

Maybe this isn't an endorsement of this book as much as the Rust programming
language itself. Wow... most languages seem like a mix of good and bad
things, but Rust seems polished. The syntax makes sense, the standard library is full
of useful things, its designers have thought about things I hadn't.

The "big idea" behind Rust is about creating a modern language _without_ garbage collection.
It's a compromise between usability and performance, but I think Rust really nailed it.
The compiler keeps track of what code _owns_ a piece of memory, so it knows when it can deallocate it.
This is all done automatically, at compile time.

If you're intrigued ... you might want to go read up what all the fuss is about.

## Non-Fiction

### Toyota Kata

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0071635238/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/0071635238.jpg" alt="Toyota Kata" /></a>

I have read many books about Toyota and I always find them interesting. But,
with so many books about Toyota, what else is there to talk about?

Many companies read about Toyota, implement some of the solutions but they
don't necessarily work. The main insight is that people focus on what Toyota
does (kanban, for example) without trying to understand how Toyota came up with
that solution. The "Toyota Way" is a way of thinking rather than a series of
practices.

One story in the book struck me, consultants being upset at Toyota employees:

> ...a few years ago you were doing X, but now you're doing Y?! Which one is right?

The solutions change _because_ the problems change.

No wonder the Japanese can open their factories to visitors... the secret isn't
_what_ they do, it's _how_ they decide what they do.

### We Have No Idea

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735211523/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/0735211523.jpg" alt="We Have No Idea" /></a>

[I](https://www.youtube.com/user/voxdotcom)
[love](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey)
"[explainers](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt)"; the people who explain
topics in a way that anybody can understand. There's too much to learn and not
enough time. If someone can do the research and give me a good
overview in a fraction of the time, that's awesome.

It also means that these overviews are often "shallow" and "oversimplified"... but I
think that's a reasonable compromise. You can always dig deeper if you find it interesting.

**We Have No Idea** focuses on physics and tries to explain:

- dark matter
- dark energy
- elementary particles
- space
- time
- and more...

There is _so much_ we don't know ... and I wasn't fully aware of that until I
read this book. If you thought we had physics "solved" and the main questions
answered, this book will give you a fresh perspective.

Here's an example of what's covered in the book:

### Sapiens

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062316095/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/0062316095.jpg" alt="Sapiens" /></a>

**Sapiens** ... the unavoidable? At one point, it was everywhere and it seems like
everybody was reading the book.

In a way, Yuval Noah Harari is another "explainer". This book is _FILLED_ with
interesting ideas ... about things I never thought about.

It's a history book; it describes what happened but also covers _why_. It also
has an overarching theory of everything which is very satisfying. Suddenly, a lot of things make sense.

My complaint is the same I have with other "explainers"... when it came to
topics I am already familiar with, I found the coverage to be superficial (other
books did it better!) and misleading (it's not the full story!).

## Fiction

### Altered Carbon

_Series: 3 books, complete._

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009I6MC8/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/B0009I6MC8.jpg" alt="Altered Carbon" /></a>

When I searched for "recommended science fiction", **Altered Carbon** often made the short list.
When I heard that it was coming to Netflix, I decided to read it first.

In a way, it's a classic "detective story". There's been a murder, nobody can
figure it out, an "expert" is brought in ... you follow along and the
conclusions are shocking. Maybe you beat yourself up for not figuring it out
yourself. (it was so obvious in retrospect!) Since this is science fiction,
there is an interesting twist: the client is looking for an explanation for why
_he_ was murdered a few days before.

Although the story follows familiar detective novel lines, I think the appeal
of the book is the exploration of "what does it mean to be _you_?" In the world
of **Altered Carbon**, you can transfer your conciousness to different bodies:

- what does it mean to be a man/woman when you can transfer bodies?
- what does _race_ mean when you can transfer bodies?
- what does it mean to live forever by jumping from an older to a younger body?
- who's the _real_ you if your conciousness exists in multiple bodies at the same time?
- what is death if you can wake up in another body after a few "lost" hours?

**Altered Carbon** was written in 2002, and it feels a bit dated now. Most of these
themes have been picked up in other books. I think it was more
shocking/revolutionary when it came out.

There are 2 other books in the series, but I think **Altered Carbon** stands by itself.
I don't think it's necessary to read the sequels.

### 11.22.63

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0064HJNQK/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/B0064HJNQK.jpg" alt="11.22.63" /></a>

I have a history with Stephen King ... some of the first "serious" books I read were from him.
Even though I enjoy his writing, it's not a style I automatically reach for.

Many people mentioned **11.22.63**, so I decided to give it a try. It had been a
while since I had read Stephen King and I had forgotten how ... _rich_ the
universes he constructs are. More than most authors I read, I really feel the
characters and places he describes. He made me feel nostalgia for 1958!

If you could travel back in time, could you save Kennedy? Without giving away
too much -- what if time itself were the "bad guy"?

Most horror leaves me feeling hollow: many people died, some survived ...
it's often disappointing. This book is no different ... but the writing is so
rich and full that it makes me forgive.

### Children of Time

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZXTHNSJ/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/B06ZXTHNSJ.jpg" alt="Children of Time" /></a>

The reviews looked good, but it was just one book. If I didn't like it, it would only be one book.
But if I liked it, it would still be only one book... (a typical fiction-picking dilemma)

In the far future, the last humans and [uplifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction))
spiders come head to head in a conflict for survival.

- do humans deserve a second chance?
- is human survival worth destroying the chance of other species?

Similar to other books covering extremely long timelines, there is plenty of
interesting ground to cover. I enjoyed reading even though I wasn't sure where it
was headed.

Also, I found the ending satisfying and that's worth a lot.

### Ball Lightning

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F9ZBBVW/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/B07F9ZBBVW.jpg" alt="Ball Lightning" /></a>

After [The Three-Body Problem](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/#the-three-body-problem)
series, I was willing to give anything Cixin Liu writes a go. This is a
self-standing book, but also a sort of (optional) _prequel_ to the Three-Body
series.

While reading the first part of the book, I was reminded of the feelings I had when I read Cixin Liu before:

- this is boring...
- where is this going?

But, like before, even the irrelevant parts all came together into "oh shit!" moments later on. Some fiction
is enjoyable even if predictable ... in some ways, this is the opposite. You go along for the ride because it
takes you places you never thought about.

This one isn't for everybody. I would start with Three-Body and pick this one up if you're hungry for more.

### All Systems Red

_Series: 4 books, complete._

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076X98RLL/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2018/B076X98RLL.jpg" alt="All Systems Red" /></a>

Ah... the Murderbot Diaries. If robots that have sex are "sexbots", robots
that murder would be "murderbots".

Imagine that you are a security cyborg, that you hacked your own software so
you could make your own decisions. You kill (or protect) people for a living,
but would rather watch soap operas. There's _a bit_ more to it than that.

The books are short and hard to put down once started. They explore different
non-human perspectives on being alive. This is a hard one _not_ to recommend.
