I write software for myself. I don't try to think too hard what's useful to
other people; I just write a lot of things and see what I like. Some
experiments are useless, they seemed like a good idea at the time, but I don't
end up using them.

That's fine: [let a thousand flowers bloom](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/226950.html).

One of those experiment was [vim slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime).
At the time, it was a quick hack, something neat ... I almost didn't bother, it
seemed "obvious". It ended up being the most popular [blog post](http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/)
I ever wrote, and probably the piece of software I wrote that's used by the most people.

When I wrote [warp](https://github.com/jpalardy/warp), I felt the same way that
I did about vim slime: quick hack, fun, but no big deal. I just had too many
hosts I could SSH into and no easy way to manage them; I wanted to pick from a
list, something that I could put in git and edit by hand.

It seemed so "obvious", nothing worth showing off, and I didn't advertise it.
People just saw me using it and starting to ask "what is that?" and "can I
install that?".

Warp is just one of the many "vim pickers" I made; I have others, of
varying usefulness. They are [part](https://github.com/jpalardy/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/commands/listers.bash)
of vim dotfiles and involve buying into a lot of my customizations. So, I made an effort
and picked the warp "logic" apart, cleaned it up a bit, and I am now sharing it with the world.

The details are in the [repo](https://github.com/jpalardy/warp).
