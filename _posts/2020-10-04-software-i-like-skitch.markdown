## What is Skitch?

[Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch) is a screenshot-grabbing and
annotating software. Skitch is free and available for macOS. Here's a typical
example of how I would use it:

## Why is Skitch awesome?

It is effortless and "transparent".

That's how I feel about Skitch... I barely ever _think_ about Skitch, but I use it everyday.
It's one of the first thing I install when I set up a new computer. I've been
a fan even before [they joined Evernote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evernote#Skitch).

It is said that "a picture is worth a thousand words". It's especially true in a
world of text-based messages, whether email, slack, chat, twitter, or
otherwise. The idea that I would try to explain something in words when,
instead, I can:

- take a screenshot
- draw arrows, boxes and lines on it
- overlay some text

is _almost_ ridiculous: it's faster for me and it's faster for the people on the receiving end.

In fact, I'm annoyed when other people don't use Skitch... If you're
about to write me a thousand words, please consider sending me a screenshot
instead üòÅ

If I have one criticism about Skitch, it's that it's not overly "discoverable". Even
if you hear the name and find the homepage, it looks like this:

Is that the right page?! What does Skitch do exactly? Where is the cool demo or
tantalizing screenshots? It feels like a missed opportunity...

I've had many people ask "what software do you use to annotate your screenshots?". It's unfortunate
that such a cool little app isn't better known. (I hope this post can help, in a small way.
