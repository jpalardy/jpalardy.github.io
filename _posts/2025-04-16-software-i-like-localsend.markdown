## What is LocalSend?

[LocalSend](https://localsend.org/) is an [AirDrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop) replacement.

## Why?

From my experience, AirDrop either
- works great!
- is completely broken...

In practice, my problems came down to
- which versions of MacOS and iOS I have around
- which OS updates have been run and when
- how long since I've rebooted my devices and/or Bluetooth

It's super frustrating to think "oh, I'll just transfer this file to my computer real quick"
only to find yourself 30m later, after a few reboots, reading about AirDrop troubleshooting on Google.

## Life after Apple

It's also worth pointing out that I have lived with AirDrop misery for a long time ("just one more update/restart..."). But what finally pushed me over was

> how do I AirDrop to my Linux desktop?

Spoiler: you don't and can't.

To quote Wikipedia (emphasis mine)

> AirDrop is a **proprietary wireless ad hoc service** in Apple Inc.'s iOS, macOS, iPadOS and visionOS operating systems

## LocalSend

There's surprisingly little to say about LocalSend: it just works!

You can send or receive.

You can set "quick save" to accept any files to a directory. Alternatively, you can manually accept or set a PIN.

It can be installed on most computers and phones. All these devices can send/receive with each other.

You might have to punch a hole through your firewall (53317 tcp and 53317 udp).
