title: Using Shell Functions Casually

Most people know they can add functions to the shell, but often limit
themselves to their dotfiles.

Nothing stops you from adding functions to your running session.

## Functions in interactive shells

If you're already in a shell, you can define a function in exactly the same way
you would in a startup script, by typing it at the prompt:

```bash
# this is bash
> ll() {
  ls -l
}
> ll
# runs `ls -l`
```

```bash
# this is fish
> function ll
  ls -l
end
> ll
# runs `ls -l`
```

## Why would you do that?

Usually, I use this to handle positional arguments more easily

```bash
# this is bash
> g() {
  grep -ril "$@" .
}
> g "something"
# grep -ril "something" .
```

`grep` invocations look like `grep $WHAT $WHERE`. Here I'm hardcoding `$WHERE` (`.`) and making `$WHAT` the last argument. While I'm at it, I'm also adding some flags (`-ril`).

```bash
> g "this"
# ...
> g "that"
# ...
> g "the other thing"
# ...
```

Not having to navigate-and-edit to the second-to-last position every time makes using the command-line _delightful_.

(although for this _very specific_ case, a better solution would be [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) ðŸ˜„)

## When to use this?

If you keep running variations of the same command.

If you keep editing previous commands.

If you have a "one-shot" batch job with _a-lot-of-typing_ but not worth a script.

## Tips and Tricks

Remember that your function will disappear when you exit the shell. Consider this a feature rather than a bug: your
temporary function garbage collecting itself ðŸš€

Since this function is going away, don't feel like you need to give it a great name; the easier to type the better.

Pro tip: for a better command-line experience, you can edit your command-line in `$EDITOR` (which is a killer feature, if you didn't know...)
