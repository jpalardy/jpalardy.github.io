title: "The Best Books I Read in 2016"
category: posts
---

I have read many books in 2016 but it wasn't all good. Some books, however,
deserve to be acknowledged. I broke down my recommendations by categories:
[technical](#technical), [non-fiction](#non-fiction) and [fiction](#fiction).
There is no particular order.

I have a similar post for [2015](http://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/).

-------------------------------------------------

## Technical

### Bitcoin for the Befuddled

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/1593275730.jpg" alt="Bitcoin for the Befuddled" />

Is this a _technical_ book? It deals with technical topics
(virtual money, blockchains, cryptography, mining...), but it has cute cartoons
to help explain some of the concepts. It reminds be of my review of
[Economix](http://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/#economix)
-- edutainment: learning while being entertained, it's the best.

Does Bitcoin have to be this complicated? Can it not be explained simply? I
think this book managed to explain everything in the simplest way it _could_ be
done. It also tried to stay away from the temporary aspects of Bitcoin (specific websites or software) and
focus instead on the ideas that won't change as time passes.

## Non-Fiction

### The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/1607747308.jpg" alt="The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing" />

I saw it in a bookstore. Then, I stumbled on an
[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/garden/home-organization-advice-from-marie-kondo.html)
in the New York Times. Then, suddenly, _everybody_ was talking about it. It's a
small inexpensive book, so I decided to buy it and see what all the fuss was about.

Did it change my life? Maybe.

I've never been much of a hoarder, but I have rooms, closets, drawers and boxes
that aren't exactly tidy. When you think about why you're holding on to
physical things in your life, you probably don't have good reasons.
[The things you own end up owning you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPPvkhGZT7Y).

The book proposes a test: take something you own and ask yourself: does it
bring you joy? No? Throw it out. Then, keep doing that with everything you own.

It made me throw out A LOT of things. And it made me feel good about the process.
I wouldn't elevate this to a religion, like some people have ... but it's worth a read.

### Think Better

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/0071494936.jpg" alt="Think Better: An Innovator's Guide to Productive Thinking" />

A whole book on brainstorming. This book was mentioned in an [interesting article](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-100-10-1-method-for-game-design/) from Nick Bentley.

Everybody _knows_ how to brainstorm, right? You just blurt out your ideas
and ... you're not supposed to judge and ... magic happens!

That's mostly it -- but it's good to understand the what and the how. In practice,
there are many ways to brainstorm badly and few ways to do it well. I've
read other books that tried to explain how to do it -- and other books that
explained why brainstorming doesn't work.

Main takeaway: you can brainstorm by yourself (some people argue that's the
only way it's _really_ going to work) and you need to KEEP PUSHING, especially
when you think you're out of ideas. You need to get to the [3rd third](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+third+third+brainstorming).

Whether or not your job requires acts of creation, it inspired me to think
outside the box and to come up with more ideas than I normally would.

### Nonviolent Communication

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/189200528X.jpg" alt="Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life" />

Many people and many blog posts have independently recommended this book. And
yet, I can't say that the idea of the book, nor its title really excited me. I
found it, by accident, in a bookstore and remembered it was supposed to be
_really_ good. I bought it on a whim.

Wow... this book really made me think. It made me question how I communicate
with others. And I think, now more than ever, it's a very important book to
discuss _how_ we communicate with each other as a society.

I never realized how _violent_ we are to each other. But if you think back
about our origin as a species, about tribes and dominance, you'll find that
most of the things we say to each other carry cultural baggage.

If you're still not sure, you can watch [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nvc+marshall+rosenberg)
of the author discussing NVC (nonviolent communication).

### Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/0954452933.jpg" alt="Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air" />

Climate change is real, but maybe a bit abstract. Even if you don't believe in
climate change, you might wonder what will happen when we run out of oil.

- how do we use energy?
- where is this energy coming from?
- what can we use instead of oil and coal?
- how do we deal with the unpredictability of wind/solar?

This book skips the politics and deals quantitatively with the problem. How
much energy is there in a gallon of oil? How much energy do you need to move a
car? The physics is going to be explained to you and you're going to make these
calculations yourself.

This book paints a sobering picture of the current situation but offers
alternatives. Sooner or later, we're going to have to make some changes --
whether we like it or not.

I found this book on Bret Victor's [Climate Change](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) page.

### Whole Earth Discipline

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/0143118285.jpg" alt="Whole Earth Discipline" />

It turns out I was wrong about many things:

- nuclear energy
- transgenic crops
- farming
- poverty
- cities
- and much more...

Most ideas about what's "green" or what's good for the planet are _not_ based on
science. I don't want to oversimplify because I think this book can explain it
better than I can.

## Fiction

### Rainbows End

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/B0011T1S4Q.jpg" alt="Rainbows End" />

I kept hearing about Vernor Vinge. I started with his
[Zones of Thought series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge#Zones_of_Thought_series),
which I enjoyed but can't recommend without serious caveats.

Rainbows End, meanwhile, is a self-standing book about an unspecified near
future, augmented reality, ubiquitous computing, AI, mind-control ... a vision
about the impact of technology on society.

If you want good science fiction that goes beyond "aliens-and-spaceships" with a
story that makes you think, I recommend you give it a try.

### Death's End

<img style="float: right" src="{{site.url}}/assets/best-books-2016/B01LW7NVP0.jpg" alt="Death's End" />

This is the last book in the "three-body" series. I read the first two books
last year and [recommended](http://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/#the-three-body-problem)
them. At that time, I hadn't finished the series because this book hadn't been
translated yet.

I bought the book the day it came out in September and I wasn't disappointed :-)
