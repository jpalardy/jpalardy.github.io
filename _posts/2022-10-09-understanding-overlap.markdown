## tl;dr

The answer is on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306316/determine-if-two-rectangles-overlap-each-other):

```cpp
if (RectA.Left < RectB.Right && RectA.Right > RectB.Left &&
    RectA.Top > RectB.Bottom && RectA.Bottom < RectB.Top)
```

which is correct but not especially obvious.

A _LOT_ of people think the stackoverflow answer is wrong and try to "fix" it ðŸ¤£

## Step by step: in one dimension

Let's simplify the problem:
- let's focus only on one dimension -- the x axis
- let's use rectangles -- just ignore their heights  
  _(it's easier to visualize than line segments)_

How can 2 rectangles overlap in one dimension?

[![examples of overlap with rectangles](/assets/overlap/overlap-examples.png)](/assets/overlap/overlap-examples.png)

There seems to be a lot of cases ðŸ¤”
- left of B could be inside A
- (or) right of B could be inside A

[![show partial overlap](/assets/overlap/simple-cases.png)](/assets/overlap/simple-cases.png)

But what about this?

[![show complete overlap](/assets/overlap/inside-case.png)](/assets/overlap/inside-case.png)

Both sides of B are inside A. **But neither of A's sides are inside B.** We need symmetry...

What are we left with?
- left of B could be inside A
- (or) right of B could be inside A
- (or) left of A could be inside B
- (or) right of A could be inside B

Simple? Did we cover all the cases? (no! read until the end)

Personally, that's when I turned to stackoverflow.

## A different perspective

If overlap is hard to pin down, let's try to define the opposite: what does it look like when rectangles do NOT overlap?

[![revisit two rectangles that do not overlap](/assets/overlap/no-overlap.png)](/assets/overlap/no-overlap.png)

in English:
- A is to the left of B
- (or) A is to the right of B

let's turn this to pseudo-code:

```javascript
no_overlap = a.right < b.left || a.left > b.right
// in other words, overlap is the inverse
overlap = !(a.right < b.left || a.left > b.right)
```

[De Morgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) say that:

- not (A or B) = (not A) and (not B)
- not (A and B) = (not A) or (not B)

```javascript
// unchanged, from above
overlap = !(a.right < b.left || a.left > b.right)

// applying De Morgan: conditions inverted, || becomes &&
overlap = !(a.right < b.left) && !(a.left > b.right)

// flipping > and < comparisons
overlap = a.right > b.left && a.left < b.right

// reorganizing order of conditions (to match stackoverflow...)
overlap = a.left < b.right && a.right > b.left
```

Looping back to the beginning, check the first line of answer:

```cpp
if (RectA.Left < RectB.Right && RectA.Right > RectB.Left &&
    RectA.Top > RectB.Bottom && RectA.Bottom < RectB.Top)
```

## What about 2d?

The same "to-the-left-of" or "to-the-right-of" cases apply. You also need to consider "above" and "below" cases.

_(top and bottom are relative to ... the direction of your y-axis)_ ðŸ˜¬

```javascript
// unchanged, from above
overlap = !(a.right < b.left || a.left > b.right ||
            a.bottom > b.top || a.top < b.bottom)

// applying De Morgan: conditions inverted, || becomes &&
overlap = !(a.right < b.left) && !(a.left > b.right) &&
          !(a.bottom > b.top) && !(a.top < b.bottom)

// flipping > and < comparison
overlap = a.right > b.left && a.left < b.right &&
          a.bottom < b.top && a.top > b.bottom

// reorganizing order of conditions (to match stackoverflow...)
overlap = a.left < b.right && a.right > b.left &&
          a.top > b.bottom && a.bottom < b.top
```

Back to this:

```cpp
if (RectA.Left < RectB.Right && RectA.Right > RectB.Left &&
    RectA.Top > RectB.Bottom && RectA.Bottom < RectB.Top)
```

## Edge Case

What case did we miss earlier?

[![identical rectangle in perfect overlap](/assets/overlap/complete-overlap.png)](/assets/overlap/complete-overlap.png)

- 2 rectangles
- same dimensions
- exactly on top of each other

In that case, neither rectangles is _inside_ the other... but the stackoverflow solution works for all cases ðŸ˜„

## Discussion

Depending on your situation, the width of your rectangle boundary (1 pixel, or whatever units)
might make a difference: consider changing `<`/`>` to `<=`/`>=` if needed.
