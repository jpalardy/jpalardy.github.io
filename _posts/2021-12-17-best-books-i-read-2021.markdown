title: The Best Books I Read in 2021
category: posts
---
I have read many books in 2021; let's forget most and talk about the good ones.

There is no particular order, but I broke down my recommendations by
categories: [technical](#technical), [non-fiction](#non-fiction) and
[fiction](#fiction).

This is a yearly tradition! You can read my book reviews from previous years:  
[2015](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/) [2016](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2016/) [2017](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2017/) [2018](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2018/) [2019](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2019/) and [2020](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2020/).

## Technical

### Crafting Interpreters

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582930/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2021/0990582930.jpg" alt="Crafting Interpreters" /></a>

I knew I would buy and read this book since the first time I heard about it.

I loved [Nystrom's previous book](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2020/#game-programming-patterns) and this is more of the good stuff.
It's _deep_ but strangely light-hearted.

If you follow along, you'll end up writing not one but two (!)
interpreters: one in Java and another more optimized and lower-level
in clean/modern C.

This wasn't my first look at interpreters (see [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book)), but it felt better organized.
There were no leaps of faith; it was a logical progression with reasonable compromises (discussed in the text).

Some caveats:

- you'll need an interest in the details of interpreters; which might not be immediately applicable on a day-to-day basis
- it's really two books in one (it's the size of a phone book!) -- I would have been perfectly happy to stop after the first (Java) interpreter. The second half of the book was interesting, but I was getting a little tired by then... ðŸ˜…

## Non-Fiction

### Your Money or Your Life

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143115766/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2021/0143115766.jpg" alt="Your Money or Your Life" /></a>

When I read an article about a man who retired in his early 40s and he mentioned
that <strong>Your Money or Your Life</strong> had changed his life ... I was intrigued. What am I missing? Why am I not retired?! ðŸ¤”

To be honest, I spent most of the book rolling my eyes ðŸ™„. This felt so obvious... I've read other books and my finances are in order; I'm not starting from zero!

But ... the major insight, from my perspective, was about cashflow: if you have more passive revenue than expenses; you can retire. The very short version:

- calculate all your expenses, every month
- cut everything superfluous; the more you spend, the more you need to finance your lifestyle -- that's what the book title refers to: you exchange your life/time against money to pay for things
- retire when `$monthly_expenses = $total_retirement_money * 5% / 12`

Obviously, the devil is in the details. And you might not agree with the premise or the conclusions. In my case, it gave me a target, and a framework.

### How Asia Works

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802121322/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2021/0802121322.jpg" alt="How Asia Works" /></a>

Following a Twitter thread, I ended up on [this post](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/against-hickelism). This quote caught my eye:

> My friend once joked that I was a neural net trained on the book How Asia Works, since I recommend it so often.

For another (shorter) take, Bill Gates also [reviewed the book](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/How-Asia-Works).

> How did countries like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China achieve
> sustained, high growth and turn into development success stories? And why
> have so few other countries managed to do so?
>
> [...]
>
> He offers a simple, three-part formula:
> 1. Create conditions for small farmers to thrive.
> 2. Use the proceeds from agricultural surpluses to build a manufacturing base that is tooled from the start to produce exports.
> 3. Nurture both these sectors (small farming and export-oriented manufacturing) with financial institutions closely controlled by the government.

It seems that countries that "made it" followed a variation of this script --
in contrast to unproven neoliberal alternatives. Faced with western economists, the best idea
might be to agree ... and completely ignore their ideas.

### How Your House Works

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119467616/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2021/1119467616.jpg" alt="How Your House Works" /></a>

How would you (really) build a house?

I found this book while trying to answer this question beyond hand-waving
explanations and generalities.

But <strong>How Your House Works</strong> is a slightly different book. I had
planned to read other [books by the same author](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3ACharlie+Wing&s=relevancerank&text=Charlie+Wing&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1), but this one certainly looked
simple, well-illustrated, and had excellent reviews.

From the introduction:

> After observing neighbors, friends, and family through decades of home
> ownership, I'm convinced most live in a perpetual state of anxiety. The log
> cabin with a privy, a fireplace, and a bucket for hauling water has been
> replaced by homes with sophisticated wiring, plumbing, and appliances. What
> happens if something goes wrong?

Beyond the child-like glee how looking inside things and figuring out how
things work ... I learned <strong>many things</strong> I didn't know. If that sounds like your
kind of thing, you'll be delighted too.

## Fiction

### The Ministry for the Future

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K1YZBYN/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2021/B08K1YZBYN.jpg" alt="The Ministry for the Future" /></a>

I've read, and recommended, almost everything that [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson) wrote. He mentioned that it might be his last big novel... ðŸ˜¢

When [Ministry for the
Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future) came out, it
was hard to miss: there were a
[bunch](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/10/kim-stanley-robinson-ministry-future-science-fiction)
[of](https://ew.com/books/the-ministry-for-the-future-climate-change/)
[articles](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/qa-kim-stanley-robinson/)
about it. A quote struck me:

> It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.

If capitalism is a [dead end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_capitalism), because its externalities will eventually kill us all, what are the alternatives?
And if there are none, or we can't imagine them, things are grim indeed.

The [book came up again](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/09/climate-crisis-kim-stanley-robinson) recently, to frame some of the recent climate disasters.

As a society, we are going to need to make some tough decisions. And
I believe things are going to be bad. This book can give you an idea of what's to come.

### Inhibitor Phase

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F92QRBP/"><img class="book-cover" src="/assets/best-books-2021/B09F92QRBP.jpg" alt="Inhibitor Phase" /></a>

<strong>Inhibitor Phase</strong> is book 7 of the [Revelation Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_Space) series.
I [already gave the first books](https://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/best-books-i-read-2015/#revelation-space)
my seal of approval. It was good then and it's still good now.

This year, I first read [Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01282ENRS/) (book 6). It contained two excellent short stories, on the sidelines of the main story. It threw me back into that universe.

The prologue mentions that <strong>Inhibitor Phase</strong> could be a self-standing book; not necessarily requiring having read the rest of the series. I'm not 100% sure that's true ðŸ¤”

It can be intimidating to jump into such a long series; not knowing exactly what you are getting yourself into... I would still recommend giving it a try; starting from the beginning.
