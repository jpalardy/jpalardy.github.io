title: "Watch ANY Video Faster"
category: posts
---

I posted [Watch YouTube Faster](/posts/watch-youtube-faster/) a few years ago.

My opinion hasn't changed: for _some_ videos, it's WAY better to watch faster.

I have already saved hours (days?) of my life.
Watching faster also means that I watched things I wouldn't have watched otherwise. (too long, lack of patience...)

What changed is what I use.

## Video Speed Controller

There's a Chrome extension called [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk).
It's written by the awesome [Ilya Grigorik](https://www.igvita.com/) and the [code is on Github](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed).

What's best about this is that it works with:

- youtube
- netflix
- coursera, edx
- ...

but also with any HTML5 video out there! If it's video and inside a web page,
chances are that it's going to work for it.

You can control the speed in increments of 0.1x, and there's a bunch of keyboard shortcuts (as shown in the screenshot).

This Chrome Extension is one of the first thing I install on any computer I use. It's hard to go back once you get used to it.
