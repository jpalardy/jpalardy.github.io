When doing numerical operations on the headers, the strings get converted
to zero... To ignore this problem, remove the first line:

    cat netflix.tsv | sed 1d ...

You can also align the output columns with:

    ... | column -t

-------------------------------------------------

* only print the 'Date', 'Volume', 'Open', 'Close' columns, in that order

    cat netflix.tsv | awk '{print $1, $6, $2, $5}'

You have to count the columns, but it's simple otherwise.


* only print lines where the stock price increased ('Close' > 'Open')

    cat netflix.tsv | awk '$5 > $2'

A missing action means print.


* print the 'Date' column and the stock price difference ('Close' - 'Open')

    cat netflix.tsv | awk '{print $1, $5 - $2}'

Numerical operations on columns are permitted.


* print an empty line between each line -- double-space the file

    cat netflix.tsv | awk '{print $0 "\n"}'

There are MANY other ways of doing that... but I didn't want to
use something I hadn't explained yet.
